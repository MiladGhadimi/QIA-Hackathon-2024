# QIA-Hackathon-2024

Steps of the challenge: 
1. Create the four-qubit cluster state by ini6alizing all qubits on the server in the |+> state 
and performing local complementa6on on qubit 2 [5] 
2. Verify that you can perform a single-step Grover search on this state using the method 
from [4]. Compare this to the equivalent quantum circuit. 
3. Send a qubit from a client and use this qubit to control the measurement angle of a 
qubit in the resource state [2,4] 
4. Execute the Grover circuit by telepor6ng two client qubits, and sending the necessary 
classical informa6on to the server
